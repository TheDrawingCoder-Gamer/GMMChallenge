# Rust: cligmm

This is the rust flavor of cligmm.

This app is not fully stable; It panics and has little to no error correction code. 
However, it's much safer than the C flavor as it is the "safe" language. 

This implemention is the most sane out of the 3. It has all the features specified in the top level readme.
